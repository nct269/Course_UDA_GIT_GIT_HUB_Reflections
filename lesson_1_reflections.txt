How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Comparing file without bugs and with bugs allow to spot fast what has changed, hence what has most likely introduced the bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The size of the commit is a judgment call, it is difficult for an automatic commit system to detect what is a unit ogical change.
    On the other hand the manual commit put you at risk to do not enough or to many commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The purpose of these different system are different.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log I can identify the init commit and the last one and I can compare them with the diff tool.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now I know that I can spot version where I introduced bugs, spot the changes to correct the undesried effects

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For the develpoment of my girlfriend websit, and for the IT infrastructure of the company I am about to start.
